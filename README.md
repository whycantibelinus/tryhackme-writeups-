# TryHackMe Practice — David Walkup

This repository contains writeups and proof-of-practice from TryHackMe learning rooms and CTF-style challenges.  
I use this to document skills, show hands-on practice, and demonstrate ethical/authorized testing experience.

## Structure
- Each room has its own folder with a `walkthrough.md` and `screenshots/`.
- Proof is limited to lab environments; no exploit code for live systems is published.

## Notable rooms
- Offensive Security Intro — `offensive-security-intro/`
- [add more rooms as you complete them]
